# Frank The Chatbot

This is my school project

My task was to make a chatbot.

My chatbot is named Frank.

I used python to code this chatbot.

You can read how i did it in the comments i made in the code.

I coded this myself but used youtube as help somethimes.

## How it works
### This are the questions Frank can answer

```

qna = {
    "hi":"hey",
    "how are you":"i am fine",
    "what is your name":"my name is Frank",
    "how old are you":"i am 1 years old",
    "what is the time now" : now,
}
```
## Typewriter effect

I used this code: 

```
def typewriter_effect(text):
    for char in text:
        print(char, end='', flush=True)
        time.sleep(0.05)  # Adjust the delay as per your preference
    print()
```

## Installation

Step 1: Place .py document in your computer wherever you like.


# Thank you
